Matcha, dating app of the future. (Group web project at WeThinkCode)

The aim of this project is to create a dating Website much like tinder. A user can create a profile, search other users, like them and begin a conversation with a built-in chat if the person liked them back. Users should be able to set prefences as to the sec of the people they will be shown, age range and popularity (amount of likes a user has recieved).

The only limitation with this project is that we are only allowed to use micro-frameworks.
